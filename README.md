# What is this?
Well I needed to brush up on Python. So I looked up a bunch of bunch resources for coding exercises and teaching materials. So I went through them each and skipped to the project requested and built the project. If the project requested wasn't encompassing enough for ramp up I created my own project.

# Did this take 100 days?
No, I'd say all around time was closer to 5 days.

# With this can I learn to build 100 applications in 5 days?
I'd venture to say no. Depending on app size/needs/integrations/etc. A decent sized greenfield application is going to be around 13-26 weeks, some take longer (especially if reverse engineering is required). This is more what I'd call very scoped module development. This is no way representative of what an app would look like if interopability, architecture, and other application specific needs would look like as each script is isolated and self reliant without an intent to talk to the other scripts unless explicitly shown to do so.
