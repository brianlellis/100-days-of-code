# What is this?
Well I needed to brush up on Python. So I looked up a bunch of bunch resources for coding exercises and teaching materials. I went through them each, skipped to the project, requested for each chapter, and built the project. If the project requested wasn't encompassing enough for ramp up I created my own project.

# Did this take 100 days?
No, I'd say all around time was closer to 5 days. Well, that's actually a guess as I'm only in my 3rd hour since starting this repo. So we'll see. Right now I'm dong 2/3 exercises per hour ~8hr daily.

# With this can I learn to build 100 applications in 5 days?
I'd venture to say no. Depending on app size/needs/integrations/etc. A decent sized greenfield application is going to be around 13-26 weeks, some take longer (especially if reverse engineering is required). This is more what I'd call very scoped module development. This is in no way representative of what an app would look like if interopability, architecture, and other application specific needs would look like as each script is isolated and self reliant without an intent to talk to the other scripts unless explicitly shown to do so.

# Should this be used to learn Python?
Again, I'd say no. These scripts are going to range in complexity and may jump several skill levels and pattern complexities in one go. This repo is not meant to teach Python. It's only meant for myself to brush up and as such there's already going to be a lot I already know from working across multiple languages that I'll pull out and just adjust syntactically for Python purposes.

# Where do I get my exercises?
Anywhere; Udemy, Interviews, Blogs, L33t/HackerRank/GeeksForGeeks, Advent of Code  
If you can search it on the web or have it heard by another person that's where my exercises come from.
