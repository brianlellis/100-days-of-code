# What is this?
Well I needed to brush up on Python and React Native. So I looked up a bunch of bunch resources for coding exercises and teaching materials. I went through them each, skipped to the project, requested for each chapter, and built the project. If the project requested wasn't encompassing enough for ramp up I created my own project. A lot of these courses would say things like 30/60/90 days of programming. I code everyday so that wasn't a seller for myself but it the amount of exercises and brush up was worth it so I decided to leave the name and just code.

# Did this take 30/60/90/100 days?
No, depending on size of the exercise I average 2-5 per hour and generally when I do these exercises I put 6-8hr of time aside to run through the exercises. 

# With this can I learn to build 100 applications in 100 days?
I'd venture to say no. Depending on app size/needs/integrations/etc. A decent sized greenfield application is going to be around 13-26 weeks, some take longer (especially if reverse engineering is required). This is more what I'd call very scoped module development. This is in no way representative of what an app would look like if interopability, architecture, and other application specific needs would look like as each script is isolated and self reliant without an intent to talk to the other scripts unless explicitly shown to do so.

# Should this be used to learn Python?
Again, I'd say no. These scripts are going to range in complexity and may jump several skill levels and pattern complexities in one go. This repo is not meant to teach Python. It's only meant for myself to brush up and as such there's already going to be a lot I already know from working across multiple languages that I'll pull out and just adjust syntactically for Python purposes.

# Where do I get my exercises?
Anywhere; Udemy, Interviews, Blogs, L33t/HackerRank/GeeksForGeeks, Advent of Code, etc.  
If you can search it on the web or have it heard by another person that's where my exercises come from.

# Are more languages/frameworks going to be included?
Most likely, depends on what I need as a personal resource or what I'm in the fancy to code at the time. My public repo is full of other languages and framework solutions so you might find something that fits your needs in here.
